                <h5>WHAT IS ANTENATAL CARE (ANC)?</h5>
                <p>Antenatal care is the care you get throughout pregnancy until you have your baby. It prepares you to have a safe pregnancy and a healthy baby</p>
                
                <h5>WHO NEEDS ANTENATAL CARE?</h5>
                <p>All women who are pregnant need to have this special care</p>
                
                <h5>MUST I GET ANTENATAL CARE?</h5>
                 <p>Yes, you should! This is because it could determine whether you will carry the pregnancy alive and whether your baby will live during and after delivery. It gives you the opportunity to recognize any danger that might show up while you are pregnant or around the time you will have your baby</p>
                
                <h5>WHERE CAN I GET ANTENATAL CARE?</h5>
                <p>All government hospitals and registered health facilities around you but you must register with them as soon as you know you are pregnant</p>
                
                <h5>HOW MUCH DOES ANTENATAL CARE COST?</h5>
                <p>This might vary from health care center to another. If you have already registered with a hospital or clinic and you want further follow up, kindly sign up to get personalized services such as get reminders or link this service to your health center</p>
